# Flatland
DNN project for convex optimisation.

Notes:
Use train.py to run training with appropriately set parameters (batch size, learning rate for SGD, model and dataset, etc.). Each experiment receives a unique id, id to parameter setting mappings are being saved to 'log' file. Experiment ids are used to load training histories back and run post-training calculations and visualizations.
